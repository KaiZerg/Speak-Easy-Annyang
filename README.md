# Speak-Easy-Annyang
In this project I  used Annyang to enhance a task management app with voice commands. I made it possible, in task management app, users can use voice commands to add items to the list.  First allow the site to access your microphone by clicking the Allow button at the top of the page. Then, loudly say "Add milk" to add a new item to the list.
